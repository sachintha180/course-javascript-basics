JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language. It can be run on the browser or on your computer locally. JavaScript can be coded anywhere, even on a simple text editor or the notepad feature on a laptop. However, in order to enhance programming experience, many tools such as editors and debuggers exist to make JavaScript coding easier and more interactive for the user.
